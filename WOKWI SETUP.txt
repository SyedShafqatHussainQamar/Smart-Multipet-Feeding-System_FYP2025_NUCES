Wokwi Circuit Simulation Setup

First, create your circuit online using Wokwi https://wokwi.com/, a platform for simulating Arduino, ESP32, and other microcontroller-based projects. After completing your design, follow these steps to run the simulation locally:

Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on your PC.

Install the required extensions by following the tutorials in these videos:

Open your project folder in VS Code and run the simulation as demonstrated in the videos.

This allows you to test and develop your microcontroller projects offline with a professional workflow.
